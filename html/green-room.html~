<h1>The Green Room</h1>
<p>The first is considered our clean building, and its where you can find people working on anything from 3d printing to sewing, or maybe even combining the two. We have a large common area devoted as a general workspace and hangout zone, and we call this the green room.</p>

<p>We provide most of our hand tools in this room, soldering irons, oscilloscopes, laser cutters, pcb etchers, hammers, screwdrivers, drills etc.<p>
